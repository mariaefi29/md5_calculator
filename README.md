## Building an application locally

1. Make sure you have MongoDB database running either locally or remotely. [MongoDB installation process](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
2. Create an environmental variable DB_CONNECTION_STRING and assign it to an url of your MongoDB database. For example: mongodb://localhost/blog
3. Run `make` in a command line in a working directory.
4. Start "playing" with the application.
